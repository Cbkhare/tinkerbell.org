An easy way to try out Tinkerbell locally is via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).

Vagrant wraps and glue together different technologies to help you write as
code repetitive environment mixing virtualization or cloud providers such as
VirtualBox, libvirt, AWS, GCP with provisioning techniques like Puppet, Ansible,
Bash.

In this context we use VirtualBox or libvirt as a virtualization platform and
bash for provisioning all the required tools and configurations.

Following this tutorial you will end up with a provisioner up and running and a
worker ready to handle actions and workflows.

## Prerequisite

A bunch of information you have to know and tools you have to install in order
to be up and running with the following tutorial.

### Ubuntu/Debian

1. Check if the CPU virtualization is enabled.

```
$ grep -o 'vmx\|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
```

2. You may download and install Vagrant from the downloads page [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

3. Install a Vagrant provider of your choice â€” libvirt or VirtualBox.

3a. For libvirt: install KVM, libvirt, QEMU and other dependencies.

```
$ sudo apt update && apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils libguestfs-tools virt-manager
```

3b. You can download and install VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack from their downloads page [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### macOS

1. You can use brew to install VirtualBox and Vagrant.

```
$ brew cask install virtualbox
$ brew cask install vagrant
```

2. The worker will start with UI enabled, the first time it will ask for
   VirtualBox permissions around "Input Monitoring". It is expected just allow
   them.

## Project foldering

1. Clone `tink` and move inside `deploy/vagrant` directory. This folder contains
   vagrant configuration (Vagrantfile) and the scripts needed to provision
   workers and provisioner.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink.git
$ cd tink/deploy/vagrant
```

## Start the provisioner

```

When the provisioner is ready, a summary is printed to the console and you can
now ssh in.

### Connecting with the servers

All the following commands are to be executed being in the artifacts' directory created
above, unless stated otherwise.

Connect to the provisioner via ssh, vagrant has an until:

```
$ vagrant ssh provisioner
vagrant@provisioner:~$
```

At this point you are in an Ubuntu box that has a couple of utils installed and
it is not time to start the services to make it a proper Tinkerbell provisioner

```
$ sudo su -l
$ cd /vagrant && source envrc && cd deploy
$ docker-compose up -d
```

!TIPS The important sections of the automation script used to bring up the
Tinkerbell stack are explained [here](/setup/vagrant/script/).

When you are done with these commands you have a fully working provisioner that
is ready to receive templates and workflow targeting workers. You can check that
running:

```
$ docker-compose ps
        Name                      Command                  State                             Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
deploy_boots_1         /boots -dhcp-addr 0.0.0.0: ...   Up
deploy_cacher_1        /cacher                          Up             0.0.0.0:42111->42111/tcp, 0.0.0.0:42112->42112/tcp

deploy_registry_1      /entrypoint.sh /etc/docker ...   Up (healthy)
deploy_tink-cli_1      /bin/sh -c sleep infinity        Up
deploy_tink-server_1   tink-server                      Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:42113->42113/tcp, 0.0.0.0:42114->42114/tcp
```

### Configure worker hardware

At this point the provisioner is running and we can follow the [example called
"Hello world"](/examples/hello-world) but I will contextualize it for our vagrant
setup here.

SSH in the provisioner again and we have to define our hello world template and
load it to tinkerbell:

```
$ cat > hello-world.yml
version: "0.1"
name: hello_world_workflow
global_timeout: 600
tasks:
  - name: "hello world"
    worker: "{{.device_1}}"
    actions:
      - name: "hello_world"
        image: hello-world
        timeout: 60
$ docker exec -i deploy_tink-cli_1 tink template create --name hello-world < ./hello-world.yml
Created Template:  75ab8483-6f42-42a9-a80d-a9f6196130df
```

Now we have to register the future worker (hardware) to tinkerbell

```
$ cat > hardware-data.json
{
  "id": "ce2e62ed-826f-4485-a39f-a82bb74338e2",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "allow_pxe": true,
  "allow_workflow": true,
  "facility_code": "onprem",
  "ip_addresses": [
    {
      "address": "192.168.1.5",
      "address_family": 4,
      "enabled": true,
      "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
      "management": true,
      "netmask": "255.255.255.248",
      "public": false
    }
  ],
  "network_ports": [
    {
      "data": {
        "mac": "08:00:27:00:00:01"
      },
      "name": "eth0",
      "type": "data"
    }
  ]
}

$ docker exec -i deploy_tink-cli_1 tink hardware push < ./hardware-data.json
2020/06/17 14:12:45 Hardware data pushed successfully
```

Now that we have a template and hardware registered we can trigger the workflow
for that particular hardware but first a bit of context on what we just did:

1. A template is used to create workflows. Template are important because you
   can create as many workflows you need from a single template.
2. A workflow needs a target (a hardware) in vagrant it is the worker and it is
   identified via mac address.

Let's start the workflow where `-t` is the template ID you got when registering
your template and `-r` contains the variable that has to be replaced in the
template, in our case only the mac address for the worker is required:

```
$ docker exec -i deploy_tink-cli_1 tink workflow create \
    -t 75ab8483-6f42-42a9-a80d-a9f6196130df \
    -r '{"device_1":"08:00:27:00:00:01"}'
Created Workflow:  a8984b09-566d-47ba-b6c5-fbe482d8ad7f
```

At this point we need to spin up our first worker

## Start a worker

You can open a new terminal and get inside the `tink/deploy/vagrant`.

For a worker the mac address works as a unique identifier, with Vagrant we are
able to set it to `080027000001`. In this way you can rebuild it and it will
consistently get the same identifier.

As you did for the provisioner let's start the worker via vagrant:

```
$ vagrant up worker
```

If using VirtualBox, the worker shows up in a UI and if everything is right you
should see at the end of the boot a login to a custom Alpine that tinkerbell
netboot and it currently runs in RAM. You can login with the username `root` and
it does not require any password.

That's it! Let us know what you think about it on [Slack](/community-slack).
